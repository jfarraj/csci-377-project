- Make a doubley linked-list for implementing to the list for the accounts
- Bank system 
    - add accounts 
    - call for balances
    - deposit and withdrawal 
    - transfer money to other accounts
    - etc. pending (add ideas)
- What should be the account number?:
    - it is a double digit variable that will determine the id of the account beside the person's name
- BankList.h
    - will hold all the nodes and be able to display information of the users
    - should be able to:
        - func: addNewAccount(name, accountnumber, checking, savings)
            - add new person and their node to the list
        - call for account names based off of account numbers (func: getAccInfo(int accNum))
        - assign account numbers randomly (01-10) (func: assignAccNum())
            - this will need:
                - rng inside the function itself 
                - new account's name
                - new account's balance and savings
                - it uses the setter from the person's class
        - sending money to savings and or checking (func: transferSelf(int accNumOrigin, double amountSending, bool saveOrCheck))
                - true: savings, false: checking
            - adding a savings account in the person's class
        - call for balances based off account number (func: getBalance(int accNum))
            - This will display both the checking and savings of the account
        - sending money to another account(func: payment(int accNumOrigin, double amountSending, int accNumDestination))
            - Always default to user's checking acount.
    - Display methods (using comparison algorithms)
        - func: displayAccounts()
            - Will display all users from smallest account numbr to largest account number
        - func: displayUserCheckings()
            - Will display all user checking accounts from least to greatest
        - func: displayUserSavings()
            - Will display all user savings accounts from least to greatest
        - func: displayWealth() - option 
            - will displau all the user's gross account value from least to greatest
        -
